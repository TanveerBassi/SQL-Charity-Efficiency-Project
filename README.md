A project that takes top 10 charities from the Charity Commison and finds the most charitiable based on the funds they donate to charitable activities (rather than administrative or fundraising expenses) 

Ranking Criteria:

    Expenditure - Charitable (amount spent on actual charity work)
    Expenditure - Total (total expenses including fundraising & admin costs)
    Ratio Calculation:
    Charity Efficiency=Expenditure - CharitableExpenditure - Total×100
    Charity Efficiency=Expenditure - TotalExpenditure - Charitable​×100
    Higher values are better → meaning more money is going towards charity work.

How This Helps:

    A higher percentage means the charity spends more of your donation on actual charitable activities.
    A lower percentage suggests more spending on admin, fundraising, or other costs.
